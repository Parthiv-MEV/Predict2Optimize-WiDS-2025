# Learning Outcomes (Weeks 1–2)

This repository documents foundational learning in quantitative finance and financial data analysis.

## Week 1 – Financial Time Series Foundations
By the end of Week 1, I was able to:

- Understand financial price data structures (OHLCV and Adjusted Close)
- Work with asset prices as time series rather than isolated values
- Compute and interpret simple returns and log returns
- Explain why log returns are preferred in quantitative finance
- Avoid lookahead bias using rolling-window computations
- Extract common rolling features:
  - Rolling returns
  - Rolling volatility
  - Momentum
  - Correlation and covariance
- Understand key risk concepts:
  - Volatility as risk
  - Downside deviation
  - Maximum drawdown
  - Value at Risk (VaR)
- Build intuition around risk–return tradeoffs in portfolios

## Week 2 – Feature Engineering & Data Handling
By the end of Week 2, I was able to:

- Retrieve historical market data using `yfinance`
- Work with multi-index financial datasets in pandas
- Clean and preprocess time series data (handling missing dates)
- Extract meaningful features from adjusted close prices
- Apply rolling statistics programmatically using pandas
- Prepare financial features suitable for modeling or strategy research
- Develop reproducible, bias-aware data pipelines for financial analysis

## Overall Skills Gained
- Financial data intuition
- Time-series feature engineering
- Risk-aware quantitative thinking
- Practical pandas-based data manipulation
- Foundations for portfolio modeling and trading research
